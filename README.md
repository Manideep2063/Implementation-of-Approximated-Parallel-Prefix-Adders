# Implementation-of-Approximated-Parallel-Prefix-Adders
Developed high-speed adders using Parallel Prefix Adders (Kogge-Stone, Brent-Kung) to enhance computing efficiency. Conducted gate-level optimization and trade-off analysis to evaluate performance and minimize delay. Analyzed the error rates of the designed adders to ensure a balance between speed and accuracy.
